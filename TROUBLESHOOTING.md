# Troubleshooting

## I softlocked the game!
This normally occurs when you enter "Race". Find a way to contact the streamer and get them to click "back to title".

If the game softlocks in any other way, please try running "attack" first. Normally, the streamer can press the "ESC" key to resume playing.

## I'm getting an error when starting the script!
Please DM @JBMagination#5512 on Discord and give them your config.json5 file. If you do this, please make an issue [here](https://github.com/jbmagination/TwitchPlaysCC/issues) and give me your Discord name and tag.

DO NOT show your config.json5 file on GitHub. This will allow other users to chat, run commands, etc. all on your behalf.

## The script is pressing keys on my keyboard!
This is intentional. The script presses the appropriate key on your keyboard matching the default control mappings for Choice Chamber. If the controls do not work with your game, please set your control mappings on Choice Chamber:

## The game isn't starting when the bot says hello!
Try setting the `chatbot` to lowercase under `config.json5`.

## I'm having another problem that's not listed here!
Please make an issue [here](https://github.com/jbmagination/TwitchPlaysCC/issues) and I will attempt to help you.
